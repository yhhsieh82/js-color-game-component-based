#### What does this project do?
This is my first small-sized project using only javascript (without backend skill). I successfully implemented the hard mode and the nightmare mode(with limited time) using component based code structure. I learned how to use "eventlistener and event firing" to deal with the users' action on the component, and I utilized the setTimeOut function to make a countdown timer which make me have a good understanding of the use of "this" in JS.

#### How to play?
After clone the project to local. Please npm install first to get all the package that project may used.
